## Features

* **Static Catalog**

  * Stored in `src/data/fakestore-sample.js`
  * 12 products with:

    * title
    * price
    * category
    * description
    * rating
    * image (local `/public/images/`)

* **Basic Filters**

  * Category buttons

  * Extracts:

    * category
    * minPrice / maxPrice
    * ‚Äúgood reviews‚Äù preference
  * Ranks products by intent match + token overlap + rating bias

* **Product Detail Page**

  * Loads product data from local dataset
  * Displays category, rating, price, description
  * **Similar Products** section with marquee scrolling

* **Cart Integration**

  * Uses Redux store to add products to cart

## Assumptions

* Product data is **local** for demo stability (no API calls).
* NLP parsing is **rule-based** (regex + keyword mapping).
* Images are stored locally to avoid broken links.
* ‚ÄúGood reviews‚Äù is interpreted as **rating ‚â• 4.0**.
